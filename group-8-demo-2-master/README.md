# Safe driving simulator

# This safe driving simulator is based on java GUI where we are creating java based GUI and it will used java swing and java JPanel.
# We are creating images to make urban look environment in this simulator so people can actually learn real world traffic and understand #how to drive while they can enjoy and entertainment themselves using this safe driving simultor.
#Images need to be in the same directory as the java files in order to work.
# They are separated now for the sake of keeping the main git page neat
